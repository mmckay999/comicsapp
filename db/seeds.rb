# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
#   comics = Comic.create([
#   {title: 'Superman', issue: '305', publisher: 'DC Comics'},
#   {title: 'Batman', issue: '405', publisher: 'DC Comics'},
#   {title: 'Captain America', issue: '228', publisher: 'Marvel'},
#   {title: 'Iron Man', issue: '202', publisher: 'Marvel'},
#   {title: 'Fantastic Four', issue: '305', publisher: 'Marvel'}])
